# Kaggle-Wine-Reviews

Predicting wine review scores from a Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews) using R and SAS.

In an effort to use the description variable in the final analysis, the top adjectives from each wine were extracted via R and eventually turned into binary variables in the SAS model.
